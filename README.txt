This will eventually be a fully-functional game engine written
in ruby, utilizing Gosu.

Features will include:
Managed and Independent, but interconnected engine classes such as
but not limited to the following:

  Game_Manager
    Game_Objects_Manager
  UI_Manager
  World
    Camera_Manager
    Map_Manager
    Sprite_Manager
    Particle_Manager
    Audio_Manager

The design goal is to have a flexible, optimized game-engine that runs
smoothly on a variety of hardware and platforms, perhaps even those with
less-than-stellar graphics capabilities.

External scripting functionality is currently planned but not
implemented, which will allow users to extend upon the game engine without
having to modify the core.
